        <span>My name is Vlad, and this is my small project for a hypothetical real estate company, where I focus on using custom JS code and the Neomo framework.</span>
        <span>Please don't mind that some buttons in the project are inactive. The essence is all displayed in the "Our Projects" section. So, I suggest heading there to evaluate my work.

        <span>Thank you for your interest and for taking the time to explore this project!
