            <p>Hi there!</p> 
            My name is Vlad, and this is my small project for a hypothetical real estate company, where I focus on using custom JS code and the Neomo framework.
            Please don't mind that some buttons in the project are inactive. The essence is all displayed in the "Our Projects" section. So, I suggest heading there to evaluate my work.
            Thank you for your interest and for taking the time to explore this project!
